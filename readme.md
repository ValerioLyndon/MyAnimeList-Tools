### Notice

**This project has been sidelined. It will continue to receive critical support updates, but new feature development has been halted or heavily slowed until further notice.**

> Why has this happened?

I do not see enough benefit continuing this project without increased interest from members that may use this tool. It may be a catch 22 if people aren't using it due to a lack of features, I know. However I don't have usage stats, so I rely entirely on direct feedback. Since I have not received any feedback on this tool, I can only assume there are very few users and I simply don't currently have the time to spend polishing a tool that isn't being used.
